# Vulkan Triangle

This was my first attempt at using the Vulkan API in C to draw a triangle. 

I have created a coherent set of utility functions to create and destroy Vulkan resources that may be found in `vulkan_helper.c`.

This software is released into the public domain and you can use it however you like.

This project has been largely inspired by the first few lessons found here:
